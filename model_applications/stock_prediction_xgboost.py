"""
This script contains the `stock_boost` function, which is an implementation of the XGBoost machine learning 
algorithm for binary classification. Specifically, the function is designed to predict buy signals for stocks.

The function accepts training data (`X_train` and `y_train`), and test data (`X_test`). It then trains an 
XGBoost model using the binary logistic objective, applies a prediction threshold, and outputs predictions 
in the form of a buy signal.

Please note that data preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, non-numeric data, etc.) is not included 
in this function and should be performed prior to using it.
