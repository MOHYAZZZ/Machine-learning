# Mathematical Concepts for Machine Learning

This folder contains Python scripts that implement and explore several important mathematical concepts used in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science. Below are the descriptions of the scripts contained within this folder.

## Scripts

1. `disease_probability.py` - This script includes a function that calculates the probability of an individual having or not having a disease given the result of a test. The computation takes into account the test's accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population, based on Bayes' theorem, and the test's sensitivity and specificity.

2. `distance_metrics.py` - Contains a class `Metrics` with methods to calculate different types of distances and similarities between two numeric vectors or sets. Metrics included are:
   - Euclidean Distance
   - Manhattan Distance
   - Cosine Similarity
   - Jaccard Similarity

3. `sparse_matrix_multiplication.py` - Includes a function for efficiently multiplying two sparse matrices together. The function leverages the sparsity of the matrices to reduce the number of computations performed.

4. `statistics_calculator.py` - Contains a function `get_statistics` which calculates the following statistical measures on a list of numbers:
   - Mean
   - Median
   - Mode
   - Sample Variance
   - Sample Standard Deviation
   - 95% Confidence Interval for the Mean

## Importance of these Mathematical Concepts in Machine Learning

### Probability

Probability plays a pivotal role in machine learning and data science. For instance, in the `disease_probability.py` script, we use Bayesian probability to calculate the chance of a patient having a disease given a test result. This sort of probabilistic reasoning is critical in a wide range of ML tasks such as Naive Bayes classifiers, Hidden Markov Models, and Bayesian networks.

### Distance Metrics

Distance metrics or similarity measures such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Cosine similarity, and Jaccard similarity (implemented in `distance_metrics.py`) are crucial in many ML algorithms. They help measure how different or similar data instances are. They are used in clustering algorithms (like K-means, Hierarchical), anomaly detection, recommendation systems (like collaborative filtering), and dimensionality reduction techniques (like t-SNE and UMAP).

### Sparse Matrix Multiplication

Sparse matrices, where most elements are zero, are commonplace in machine learning and data science. Efficient manipulation of these matrices (as in `sparse_matrix_multiplication.py`) is crucial for computational performance. Examples of sparse data include text data for natural language processing tasks, adjacency matrices in graph theory, and user-item interactions in recommendation systems.

### Statistics

The field of machine learning is deeply connected with statistics. The script `statistics_calculator.py` calculates basic statistical measures which are often used to analyze and understand the data before and after the model training process. Confidence intervals, variance, standard deviation, mean, median, and mode are all fundamental to understanding data distributions, and hence, crucial in model selection and evaluation in ML.

In conclusion, these mathematical concepts form the foundational blocks of Machine Learning. An understanding of these concepts is crucial for designing, implementing, and evaluating machine learning models.
