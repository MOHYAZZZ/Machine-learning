# Machine Learning Self-Study Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning Self-Study repository! This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of self-studying machine learning. Here, you will find a collection of code and projects that I have worked on while exploring various aspects of machine learning.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for myself and potentially others who are interested in machine learning. I aim to document my progress, experiments, and the questions I have explored throughout my self-study journey.
